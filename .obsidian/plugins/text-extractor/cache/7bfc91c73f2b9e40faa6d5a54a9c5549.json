A commutative diagram to show visually the relationship between convolution and multiplication. If we multiply 一 and 8 in space then transform to frequency, we end up in the same place as if we transformed f and g to frequency and then convolved them. Likewise, if we convolve f and g in space and then transform into frequency, we end up in the same place as if we transformed f and g to frequency, then multiplied them.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"chi_sim+eng"}
