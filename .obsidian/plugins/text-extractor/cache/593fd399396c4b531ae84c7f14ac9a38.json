The act of raising a hand would be prominent on the top but harder to notice on the bottom. A change in nose length, on the contrary, might be completely invisible in the first case. Note that this might be intentionally hidden, for example, to be suddenly revealed later. Neither arrangement is particularly good if both motions should e attended to. Middle: The amount of anticipation can tell much about the following action. The action which is about to follow (throwing a ball) is very short, but it is clear what is about to happen. The more wound p the character is, the faster the following action is perceived to be. Right: The follow-through phase is especially important for secondary appendages (hair) whose motion follows the leading part (head). The motion of the head is very simple, but leads to nontrivial follow-through behavior of the hair itself. It is impossible to create 3 natural animation without a follow-through phase and overlapping action 讨 this case.
