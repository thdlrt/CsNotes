The de Casteljau algorithm is used to subdivide a cubic Bézier segmeat The initial points (black diamonds A, B, C, and D) are linearly interpolated to yield blue circles (AB, BC, CD). which are linearly interpolated to yield orange circles (AC, BD), which are linearly interpolated to give the point on the cubic AD This process also has subdivided the Bézier segment with control Points AB.C.D into two Bézier segments with control points A, AB, AC AD and AD, BD, CD, D.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"chi_sim+eng"}
