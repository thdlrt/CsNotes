To do this, we can first convert the angles to a unit vector a: 一 (cosbsin0,sinbsin0,cos0) As an efficiency improvement, We can avoid taking trigonometric functions of inverse trigonometric functions (e.g., cos (arccos#)). For example, when n = 1 (a diffuse distribution), the vector a simplifies to a— (cos (2n1) /B, sin (2n61) Bz, T— )","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"chi_sim+eng"}
