A curve parameterized by quadratic B-splines (k = 3) with seven control points In (a) a uniform knot vector [1,2,3.4.5,6,7.8.9,10] is used, while in (b) the nonuniform knot vector [123.44.67.8.810] ismsed The duplication of the 4th and 8th knots means that all interior points of the 3rd and 7th B-spline are equal, so the curve interpolates the control points associated with those knots.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"chi_sim+eng"}
