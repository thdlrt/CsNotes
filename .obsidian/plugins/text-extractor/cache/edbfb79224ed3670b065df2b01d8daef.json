The depth i transformed to the depth 2 by the perspective transform. Note that when 2 moves from positive to negative, 2 switches from negative to positive. Thus vertices behind the eye are moved in front of the eye beyond 2’ = 7 +/. T will lead to wrong results, which is why the triangle is first clipped to ensure all vertices are in front of the eye.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"chi_sim+eng"}
