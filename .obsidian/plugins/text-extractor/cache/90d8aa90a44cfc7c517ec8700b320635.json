For example, the parametric line connecting a and ¢ is p(t) =a+t(c—a). The point of intersection with the plane n - p 4+ D = 0 is found by plugging p(t) into the plane equation: n-(a+tlc—a))+D=0, and solving for ¢: 二 一 一 十 卫 一 e 一 Calling this solution t4, we can write the expression for A: 叔 二 a 十 训 (c 一 ).","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"chi_sim+eng"}
