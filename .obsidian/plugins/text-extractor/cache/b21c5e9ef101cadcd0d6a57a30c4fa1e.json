The results of antialiasing a challenging test scenc (reference images showing detailed structure, at left) using three different strategies: simply taking a single point sample with nearest-neighbor interpolation; using a mipmap pyramid to average a square area in the texture for each pixel; using several samples from a mipmap to average an anisotropic region in the texture.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"chi_sim+eng"}
